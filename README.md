## Introduction

The spam email classifier is designed to help identify and filter out spam emails. It uses a combination of NLP techniques to preprocess the text data and a machine learning algorithm to classify the emails.

## Features

- Preprocess email text data
- Train a machine learning model on a labeled dataset
- Classify new emails as spam or non-spam
- Evaluate the performance of the classifier

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Install Dependencies

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-email-classifier.git
cd spam-email-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Preprocess Data

Preprocess your email data using the provided scripts:

```python
from preprocess import preprocess_data

# Example usage
preprocessed_data = preprocess_data('path_to_your_dataset.csv')
```

### Train the Model

Train the spam email classifier:

```python
from train import train_model

# Example usage
train_model('path_to_preprocessed_data.csv')
```

### Classify Emails

Classify new emails using the trained model:

```python
from classify import classify_email

# Example usage
email = "Your email text here"
classification = classify_email(email)
print(f"The email is classified as: {classification}")
```

## Dataset

The dataset should contain labeled emails (spam and non-spam). You can use publicly available datasets like the [SpamAssassin public corpus](https://spamassassin.apache.org/publiccorpus/) or [Enron Email Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/).

## Model Training

The model is trained using a machine learning algorithm such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machine (SVM). The training script preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains the model, and evaluates its performance.
